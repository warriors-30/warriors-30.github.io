I am a third-year masterâ€™s student at [Cooperative Medianet Innovation Center (CMIC)](https://cmic.sjtu.edu.cn/EN/Default.aspx), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn), advised by Dr. [Jiangchao Yao](https://sunarker.github.io/). I was a research intern at [RIKEN AIP](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/), fortunately working with Dr. [Gang Niu](https://niug1984.github.io/) and Prof. [Masashi Sugiyama](https://www.ms.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sugi/). Before that, I received my B.Eng. from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn) in 2023.

My research interests lie in trustworthy and efficient AI, with a recent focus on efficient pretraining and inference of foundation models (LLMs, VLMs).
